nembexv3 requires postgresql db

nembex consist of few separate elements:

* nemUpdate - responsible for getting data from servers, analysing it and storing in db
* nemBex3 - backand for UI (frontend dir contains the frontend ;))
* async/ - contains async-based network crawler


few notes regarding backend:

* handlers that handle pages have plural forms - (i.e. transfer**s**, multisig**s**, etc.)
* handlers that handle specific things are in signular (i.e. /transfer/)
* python backend always return all the TXes, UI distinguishes if it's part of multisig or not, so you might notice {{#signature}} tags in templates
